EFIn order to understand recursion, one must first understand recursion.EoIn My Egotistical Opinion, most people's C programs should be indented six feet downward and covered with dirt.OXA C program is like a fast dance on a newly waxed dance floor by people carrying razors.E-C is quirky, flawed, and an enormous success.E²Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.OiThe trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a programmer is doing until itâ€™s too late.EÖThere are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.OrAlways code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.EvSome people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems.EfThere are 2 hard problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-1 errors.EZIf Java had true garbage collection, most programs would delete themselves upon execution.EoIf debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.OsThere are two major products that come out of Berkeley: LSD and UNIX.  We donâ€™t believe this to be a coincidence.OƒFirst off, I'd suggest printing out a copy of the GNU coding standards, and NOT read it.  Burn them, it's a great symbolic gesture.
