All the files are in the folder integrator_package in one subdir each.
To run the test_integrator, simply run the run.py file outside the package.
this will run all the test-functions in the test_integrator file.
before running the run.py it is important to run the setup script first.
you do this simply by being in the folder where setup.py is and 
type: "python setup.py install"
